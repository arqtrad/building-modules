The occurrence of modular measurements in pre-industrial construction,
whether it be related to codes mandating minimum dimensions, use of
standardised building components, proportional systems, or simple
convenience of measuring in whole units, is acknowledged to be
widespread. The scope of variations in space dimensions and the
documented or reconstructed use of specific measurement unit multiples
can serve as supporting evidence for the geographic range of building
traditions. Nevertheless, their significance in vernacular construction
is seldom accounted for beyond cases where it is explicitly documented
in primary sources, chiefly in East Asian and Anglo American carpentry
manuals of the Early Modern period, or as a questionable offshoot of
classicist theories of proportion.

In Portugal, the wide regional variation in building materials and
techniques as well as the politically charged debate on the problem of
popular architecture have discouraged inquiry into this matter, despite
there being well established histories of building codes and of modular
standards for urban design in this country. Documenting vernacular
building modules can, however, shed light on the relationship between
construction materials and spatial configurations, as well as on the
transition from traditional to industrialised building materials and
from customary measurement units to the metric system.

This ongoing research project therefore seeks to provide a computational
framework for assessing the geographic distribution and variability of
modular measurement ranges in Portuguese vernacular construction, as
well as their relationship to the use of specific structural materials.
It is chiefly concerned with base building as defined by the Italian
school of procedural typology, that is, urban and rural houses and
house-like multifunctional structures. It draws on a variety of
conceptual models of constructions, such as Philip Steadman's 'sketch
for an archetypal building' and the University of Naples's survey of the
city in the 1990s, to design a database capable of analysing modular
systems stored as abstract measurements and relationships for each
documented building. The buildings are then located in a Geographic
Information System so that the spatial distribution and range of
variation in their modules and dimensions can be visualised and
assessed. A preliminary case study and evaluation of this scheme is
presented using existing architectural surveys for a few towns in the
central Portuguese hinterland with a significant late nineteenth century
building stock.
